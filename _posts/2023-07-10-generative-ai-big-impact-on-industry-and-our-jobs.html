<p>Title: The economic potential of generative AI : the next productivity frontier. If you cannot find, just comment and let me know.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>McKinsey &amp; Company just dropped a 68-age report titled: The Economic Potential of Generative Al: The Next Productivity Frontier.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿Approximately three-quarters of the potential benefits from using generative Al can be realized in four main sectors: customer service (customer and agent experiences), sales and marketing (personalization, content creation, and sales productivity), software development (coding assistant), and research and development (reducing research and design time, improving simulation and testing).</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿Banking, retail and consumer packaged goods, high tech, and life sciences (pharma/ medical) are among the industries that could see the biggest impact as a percentage of their revenues from generative Al.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Generative Al has a more pronounced impact on knowledge-based occupations</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿Between 2030 and 2060, it is estimated that half of today's work activities could be automated, a projection that is about a decade earlier than previous estimates. This will require substantial investment in reskilling workers and supporting them in transitioning to new roles or jobs. In some cases, workers will stay in the same occupations, but their mix of activities will shift; in others, workers will need to shift occupations.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿The total net economic benefits of generative Al is expected to amount to $6.1-$7.9 trillion annually. Other traditional applications of Al continue to account for the majority of the overall potential value of Al.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, as generative Al continues to develop and mature, it has significant potential to open new frontiers and use cases</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Generative Al, technology performance is now expected to match median human performance and reach top-quartile human performance.</p>
