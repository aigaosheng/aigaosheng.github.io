<p>In around 2013, music search is becoming hot application in internet industry with the increasing coverage of mobile phone. Its intention is to provide music / song search experience using a music clip recorded by mobile phone anywhere anytime. Its challenges are robust (diverse noise e.g. town hall, road,  audio edit, pitch shift) &amp; compact audio fingerprint extraction and quick response to support real-time search. Fortunately I developed audio landmark binary feature as fingerprint and inverted document index framework for audio search (C++).
