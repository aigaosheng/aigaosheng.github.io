<p>When I live in Holland village, every weekend or holiday morning, I go to the carrot cake shop to buy breakfast for my family.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The shop only sells carrot cake, and its carrot cake is traditionally handmade. I have not find any shop cooking professionally like it. Every morning, it is a long queue about 20. Most time I need wait for 30mins. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The carrot cake cooks with carrot cake, salted dry carrot , eggs. You can watch how the boss, mother and father, cook and their son serves the customers.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>You can buy white or black carrot cake. The difference is the latter is cooked with sweet sauces. If you like chilli, the white carrot cake can mix with chilli. My family love white one with chilli.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is cheap delicious food, you can buy cheapest one for 2.5 SG dollar. But I always buy 3 dollar enough for single.</p>

<p>If you travel to Singapore, it is highly recommended food. </p>
