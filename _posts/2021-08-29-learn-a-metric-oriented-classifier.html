<p>Objective function is the mathematical formulation of how to estimate classifier parameters. The classical objective function is derived from maximal log-likelihood function on training samples for the proposed classifier. Classifier parameters are estimated by solving the objective function. But log-likelihood is not directly related to performance metric, e.g. training on likelihood, and preferred evaluation metric maybe F1, accuracy or ranking. This criteria gap between training and evaluating causes the classifier trained on log-likelihood is not optimal for F1 , classification error or ranking. This is the intention of our work on MFoM based classifier learning. Updated the work on <a href="https://aisengtech.com/project#mfom">https://aisengtech.com/project#mfom</a>. Hereafter MFoM, there are many research papers on learning classifier for specified metric in research community, in which learn-to-rank is most famous, and learn-to-rank is now a core module for modern search engine.</p>
