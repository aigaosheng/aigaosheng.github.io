<p>Everyday morning breakfast my dog, erhei, feed up roasted chicken. His best favorite. When taking his outdoor park for shit and urine, back home feed meat in his bowl. But today, I feed meat in his bowl before we leave. He saw it and ran to bowl and try to eat. But I forced him to outdoor park. The happening is after he shit and urine, he is running back home. Normally he like wandering in the park.</p>

<p>After entering into home, running to his bowl and wolfed all chicken meat and left bought dog food. </p>
