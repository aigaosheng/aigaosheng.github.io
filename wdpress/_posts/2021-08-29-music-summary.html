<p>Music summary is to extract a short clip from music recording to represent music content, which is used to engage consumer to buy music recording. A simple way is to use the beginning of audio. But it may not characterize the most engaging part of the music. I developed a music structure analysis and repeated pattern identification algorithm. The repeated pattern or segment may reflect the most engaging content in the recording, which is used as music summary.
