<p>After wake-up in the morning, read news and find the top is that squid-game cryptocurrency dropping near to zero just among a few weeks. Its price is moving from penny to 2860 and now near zero. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/02/squid-game-crypto-rug-pull/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/11/02/squid-game-crypto-rug-pull/</a></p>

<p>This cryptocurrency is not the first, but is not also the last. Many guys who want to make quick money and dream to be wealthy and finance free invest so risky product and finally they become jiucai (韭菜), and nothing have.</p>

<p>Still remember P2P companies grow wildly in China about 2015. A lot of companies created with fancy terms like finance creative and novelty, and claim high return in short term. Finally most became scam. A lot of people lose their life earning money, and the founders move money overseas and their families also move overseas.</p>

<p>Sadly heard this news. But greedy is human nature. The type of scam is not the last.</p>
